## Our Process

As a team, we felt that in order to execute on the project efficiently, we needed a solid idea of what our vision for the project was. How would we go about building MakersBnB? What would the database architecture look like?<br>
What pages did we need in order to meet the criteria in the user stories? Without having all of these questions - and many, many more - answered and agreed upon before we started to implement, our individual efforts may diverge quickly.<br>
As such, we spent the whole of Monday and part of Tuesday planning and diagramming the backend of the project.<br>
We felt it was important to keep things as simple as possible while ensuring that we met the specifications in the user stories. We kept our solution down to 3 classes and 3 database tables.
