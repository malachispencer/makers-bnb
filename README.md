## Our Process

As a team, we felt that in order to execute on the project efficiently, we needed a solid idea of what our vision for the project was. How would we go about building MakersBnB? What would the database architecture look like? What pages did we need in order to meet the criteria in the user stories? Without having all of these questions - and many, many more - answered and agreed upon before we started to implement, our individual efforts may diverge quickly.

As such, we spent the whole of Monday and part of Tuesday planning and diagramming the backend of the project. We felt it was important to keep things as simple as possible while ensuring that we met the specifications in the user stories. We kept our solution down to 3 classes and 3 database tables.
